# HR-Analytics
The purpose of this project is to perform EDA and create classifiers that predict employee attrition using IBM HR dataset. 
Please follow this link, [Understanding and Predicting IBM Employee Attrition](https://github.com/min-tee/HR-Analytics/blob/main/HR_Analytics.ipynb) for details.

## Methodology
I took procedural programming approach to solve this problem.

## Strategy : 4D of Data Science 
**Define**
- Why attrition is an issue?

**Discover**
- Import packages
- Obtain, clean and explore the data
- EDA : Univariate and multivariate statistical  approaches 

**Develop**
- Models : Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM
- Feature Engineering : One-hot Encoding
- Baseline Model
- Improve Model Performance : Feature Selection, Feature Scaling, Treat imbalanced dataset(SMOTE, Up sampling & Down sampling), Hyperparameter Tuning
- Metrics : F1-Score, ROC Graph
- Random Forest Feature Importance

**Deploy**
- Retention Strategy
