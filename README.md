# HR-Analytics
Please follow this link [Understanding and Predicting IBM Employee Attrition](https://github.com/min-tee/HR-Analytics/blob/main/HR_Analytics.ipynb) for EDA and classifiers in Python for IBM HR dataset to predict employee attrition.


The purpose of this project is to perform EDA and create classifiers to create models that will prediction employee attrition using IBM HR dataset. 


# Methodology
I took procedural programming approach to solve this problem(note - next project will be on object oriented approach).


# 4D of Data Science 
**Define**
- Why attrition is an issue?
**Discover**
- Import packages
- obtain,clean and expore the data
- EDA : univariate and multivariate statsitical  approaches 

**Develop**
- Models : Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM
- Feature Engineering : One-hot Encoding
- Baseline Model
- Improve Model Performance : Feature Selection, Treat imabalanced dataset(SMOTE, Oversampling, Undersampling), Hyperparameter Tuning
- Metrics : F1-score, ROC graph
- Feature Importance

**Deploy**
- Retention Strategy
